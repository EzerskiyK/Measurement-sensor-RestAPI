**Description**

The project is created in Java + Spring language.
It consists of two applications, namely MeasurementSensor and MeasurementSensorAPIConsumer.
MeasurementSensor simulates a sensor giving us information.
MeasurementSensorAPIConsumer imitates a client that can receive and give information to the sensor.


**Optional**

If you want to run the project, you need to set up a connection to the database.
You need to create a file bdData.properties at the path measurementSensor/src/main/resources.
You can copy the contents of bdData.properties.origin (located in the same directory) and paste the data from your database.
